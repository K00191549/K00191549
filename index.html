<h1>Jack and the <br> Beanstalk</h1>

<p id="note">&uArr; USE UP &amp; DOWN ARROWS FOR BEST EXPERIENCE &dArr;</p>

<div id="div_01" class="info">In the time of King Alfred there lived a poor widow, with 
an only son. Her son was called Jack - a very lazy fellow.</div> 

<div id="div_02" class="info">His mother had hard work to keep him and herself, and being very ailing 
she was obliged to sell nearly all her goods including her cow, so she said to Jack, "You have 
brought me to poverty, so that I must sell my cow."</div>

<div id="div_03" class="info">Jack for the first time felt that he had been a bad son, so he said to his 
mother, "Let me sell the cow, and I will be for the future good." It so happened that Jack 
met a butcher showing Jack some beautiful beans of all colours, so he said, "I  will give you 
all these beans for your cow" so Jack thought it was a great offer, and at once sold the cow.</div>

<div id="div_04" class="info">Jack now hastened home to his mother with the beans in high glee, and his mother 
was very vexed, and said he had ruined them, and for the first time lost her temper, and threw the 
beans out the window, and they both went supperless to bed.</div>

<div id="div_05" class="info">When Jack awoke in the morning he was astonished to see in the garden something 
growing so high so like a ladder that Jack said to his mother, "I will climb up and see what is 
at the top".</div>

<div id="div_06" class="info">Jack saw the castle and continued his journey, and soon arrived at the castle, and 
knocked at the door quite bold. The door was opened by the giant's wife, Jack pleaded so hard that 
she gave him some supper and hid him in the copper.</div>

<div id="div_07" class="info">The Giant soon returned, and had his supper, and soon fell asleep, and Jack now came from his hiding, 
seized the harp which played some beautiful tunes without being touched.Jack was making off with it, 
but it being enchanted, cried out, "Master, master," which soon awoke the giant.</div>

<div id="div_08" class="info">Jack soon arrived at the bottom of the bean stalk, and calling for his chopper he cut the
stalk, so that the giant fell down and was killed...</div>
